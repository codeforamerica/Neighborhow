Please submit any translations in .mo/.po format to wordpress@dd32.id.au

Also, Please, Only rely upon the .pot file when it comes to beta time, it may not be updated.
If you update from sources, please be aware that the following translation functions are used, and you'll need to tell your translation program to understand them:

Singular:
__()
_e()
esc_attr_e()
esc_attr__()

Plurals:
_n()

Dont forget to set the Plural Form in PoEdit (Or your application) as well.
If 0 1 and >1 strings are different, use:
 nplurals=3; plural=(n%10==1 && n%100!=11) ? 0 : ((n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20)) ? 1 : 2)
If 0 and >1 are the same, and 1 is different, use:
 nplurals=2; plural=n != 1


Thanks :)
